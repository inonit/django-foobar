A crash course to writing Django modules
========================================

Django has a vast ecosystem of 3rd party modules. This crash course is an attempt at writing
a guide for writing, testing, documenting and deploying such modules to `Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ -
the Python Package Index.

The concepts in this guide does not strictly apply just to Django, but can with minor adjustments be used
as a guideline for writing all sorts of portable Python modules.

It is not however; a tutorial for Python nor Django. If you are new to Django, I suggest you complete the
`Django tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/>`_ first, then come back and read
the crash course.
